# 599-Knitting-Assignments
This repository contains the code needed to complete the programming assignments in UW CSE 599 on E-Textiles for the Fall Quarter of 2021.

## Package Structure
Assignment 1 is spread across two packages and the test package

### knit_graphs
This package contains the classes used to create a knit graph (Loop, Yarn, Knit_Graph, Pull_Direction(Enum)). Methods in these classes need to be implemented to complete Assignment 1

### debugging_tools
This package contains a visualizer method to help visualize simple knitgraphs. This may be useful to extend for debugging future projects
It also contains a set of simple knitgraph which manually generate some simple textures. In future assignments we will make it easier to define more complex knit graphs. 2 of these textures need to be implemented for assignment 1
